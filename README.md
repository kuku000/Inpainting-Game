# A spot-the-difference game based on AOTGAN Inpainting technology.
## System Architecture:

## Game Rule:
This is a game that tests both memory and luck. First, you will be given an original photo and another photo with certain objects removed. You have 5 seconds to observe the differences between the two. After that, you will be shown the original image again, on which you can mark areas that you think should be removed. Once you feel you are done, submit your answer to see your score.

## Hints:
- Inpainting usually starts from the edges, so make sure to cleanly mark the boundaries.

- Random scribbles or careless markings will make things worse than not drawing at all.

- Since the system calculates similarity across the entire image, a higher similarity score doesn’t necessarily mean a perfect answer.

- The devil is in the details.

- Good luck, everyone! Our AI is powerful—you might not even notice what has disappeared!
